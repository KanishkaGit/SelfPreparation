                At some point in the past, a CPU had only one core and it was not possible to execute several computing tasks simultaneously. However Operating systems could already work with multiple programs simultaneously, implementing the concept of Multi tasking. <br>
                <warning>In order to avoid a situation, where only one program is taking control of the CPU and causing other applications and CPU itself to hang, the operating system had to somehow, create virtual processing units and provide each application with one for its own operations</warning>. <br>Morover, an operating system itself being an application running on the computing unit, needed to have priority access to the unit over other applications in order to prioritize tasks. <h-text>A thread is an implementation of this concept. It is a virtual processor given to any program that runs it independantly</h-text>.
                <hr>
                In a time of single core CPUs, this task was left to operating systems, because trying to manage a single processor to manage multiple threads would actually make the operation slower. (<warning>A thread is a process heavy operation, and in a single core many threads might lead to lag as the processor would be busy managing threads rather than executing them</warning>)
                <br>
                But with mordern multi core CPUs it is possible to manage an application by running various tasks in various threads in an application communicationg and synchronizing with each other.

                Windows in capable of running more than one applications. This Is called
                <h-text>Multi Tasking</h-text>. Internally it use something called a process.
                <h-text>A process is a part of an operating system, that is responsible for executing an application.</h-text>
                <br> A process uses something called a thread to execute the code of the application.
                <h-text>A thread is an unit that will execute the logic in an application.In simple words a thread is an unit of
                    a process.</h-text>
                <hr/>
                <success>
                    When we are using MS Word, for writing a document and playing music at the same time, we are using two processes in the operating
                    system. This can be referred to as Multi-tasking.
                    <br> Inside MS word, while we are typing, the spell check is done at the same time. Hence , in priciple the
                    sub tasks are called threads. So, in the main process of creating a document in
                    <h-text>MS word</h-text>, there are two threads that are running in the background
                    <h-text>Typing thread</h-text> and
                    <h-text>Spell Check Thread</h-text>. This is referred to as Multi Threading.
                </success>
                <hr>
                <h-text>Every process by default consists a single thread, which is called the main thread. So, by default every
                    application runs in a sigle threaded model.</h-text>
                <hr>
                <warning>The drawback of a single threaded model is that, there will be only one thread responsible for executing
                    all the methods, and hence it will be called one by one. and hence will make the system slow.</warning>
                <br>
                <hr/> Why use multithreading
                <ol>
                    <li>By default all application use only one thread. To Leverage the multicore CPU of mordern computers, multi
                        threading would faten up the operation of the same application.</li>
                    <li>
                        In longer operations, if we want the user not to wait and hence, we will run the tasks two different threads. This is also
                        called asynchronous tasks.
                    </li>
